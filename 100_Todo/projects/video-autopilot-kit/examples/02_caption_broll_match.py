"""
Example 02 — zero-config caption ↔ b-roll auto-sequencing (pure Python, no ffmpeg).

The kit's b-roll matcher needs NO keyword config to work: as long as you name
your b-roll files after their content (coffee.mp4 / sunset.mov / ramen.mp4), it
aligns each caption to the best-matching clip by shared words — so the footage
follows what the narration/caption is actually talking about.

Run:
    python examples/02_caption_broll_match.py

Needs: Python 3.9+ only. No ffmpeg, no CapCut, no real media.
